## Introduction
The earthquake visualization tool was developed for the Developing Data Products course offered by Johns Hopkins University on Coursera.  The purpose of the tool is to allow a user to explore historical earthquake data by magnitude, date, and location.  A map is drawn for a selected region, and earthquakes are overlaid on the map with scale and color corresponding to earthquake magnitude.

## User Interface
The user interface for the earthquake visualization tool was built using Shiny from RStudio. The interface allows the user to customize and explore earthquake data.

Using the inputs displayed to the left, a user can customize:

  * The date range for which seismic events are displayed
  * The range of magnitudes to be shown on the image
  * The scale of the circles representing seismic events
  * A color scheme to personalize aesthetic taste
  * A target location to explore seismic data

## Data Import
Earthquake data is a combination of two data sources:

  * The Global Historical Earthquake Archive (see [GEM](https://www.globalquakemodel.org/what/seismic-hazard/historical-catalogue/))
  * The International Seismological Centre (see [ISC](http://www.isc.ac.uk/iscgem/))

All the source code for the tool is available on [Github](github.com/suttonbm/datasciencecoursera/tree/master/Developing_Data_Products/Project/DDP_Final_Project).

While the tool was developed to be used through a Shiny UI, all the features are also available as standalone R scripts.  To load the earthquake dataset at the console, run the following:

```{r echo=F}
pathToRepo <- 'E:/programming/datasciencecoursera/Developing_Data_Products/Project/DDP_Final_Project/'
```

```{r eval=F}
source(paste0(pathToRepo, 'loadEarthquakeData.R'))
```

```{r echo=F}
rawData.M <- read.table(paste0(pathToRepo,'data/isc-gem-data.tab'))
rawData.M$date <- ymd(rawData.M$date)
rawData.M <- rawData.M[order(-rawData.M$mag),]
```

Data files will be dynamically loaded from the web if they are not available.  Note that ISC data, although freely available, must be requested at the link above.

## Plot Generation
Earthquake plots are generated using the `maps` package in combination with R base graphics.  A plot can be generated using the source package as follows:

*** =left

```{r echo=F, warning=F}
source(paste0(pathToRepo, 'generateMap.R'))
generateMap(rawData.M,
            colorMap = "inferno",
            circleScale = 3.5,
            xlim = c(-80, 80),
            ylim = c(0, 80))
```

*** =right

```{r eval=F}
source(paste0(pathToRepo, 'generateMap.R'))
generateMap(rawData.M,
            colorMap = "inferno",
            circleScale = 3.5,
            xlim = c(-80, 80),
            ylim = c(0, 80))
```
